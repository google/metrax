        "\n",
        "### Method 1: The `pmap` Approach (Simple Data Parallelism)\n",
        "\n",
        "The legacy way to scale computations across multiple devices in JAX is with `jax.pmap`. It's a powerful transformation designed for **data parallelism**, where you want to run the exact same program on different slices of data. `metrax`'s composable metrics are perfectly suited for this.\n",
        "\n",
        "`pmap` is more than just a parallel loop; it's a transformation that handles several complex steps for you automatically. When you apply `pmap` to a function like `metrax.AUCPR.from_model_output`, here's what happens:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Compile (`jit`):** First, `pmap` **JIT-compiles** your function into highly efficient machine code that is optimized for your hardware (like GPUs or TPUs). You don't need to add `@jax.jit` yourself; it's an inherent part of the `pmap` process.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Distribute (Shard):** It then automatically splits your input arrays along their first (batch) axis and sends each data \"shard\" to a different device.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Execute in Parallel:** The compiled function runs simultaneously on all devices, with each device processing its own shard of the data. This step produces a distributed `metrax` object, where each device holds the intermediate metric state calculated from its local data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Aggregate (Reduce):** To get a final, globally correct result, you call the `.reduce()` method on the output from `pmap`. This performs the necessary cross-device communication (an `all_reduce` sum) to combine the intermediate states from all devices into one.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Method 2: The `jit` and `Mesh` Approach (Advanced Parallelism)\n",
        "\n",
        "For more advanced control over distributed computation, JAX provides an explicit sharding mechanism using the `jax.sharding` API. This **SPMD (Single Program, Multiple Data)** approach is more powerful and flexible than `pmap` and is the standard for large-scale models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of `pmap`'s automatic behavior, you take explicit control over each step of the process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Define a `Mesh`**: You first create a logical grid of your physical devices and give names to the axes (e.g., `Mesh(jax.devices(), ('data',))`). This describes the topology you'll be working with.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Create a `Sharding` Rule**: You specify exactly how each dimension of your array should be mapped to the mesh's axes. This is done using `NamedSharding` and `PartitionSpec`. For data parallelism, you would shard the batch axis of your data across the `'data'` axis of your mesh.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Explicitly Place Data**: You use `jax.device_put` to apply this sharding rule to your data arrays. At this point, your JAX arrays are \"aware\" of how they are distributed across the physical hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **`jit`-Compile the Function**: You write a function that looks like a normal, single-device calculation and decorate it with `@jax.jit`. When JAX's compiler sees that the inputs to this function are sharded arrays, it automatically generates a distributed version of the code. It implicitly handles all the necessary cross-device communication, so **no explicit `.reduce()` call is needed.**\n",
        "\n",
